## Misc Setup Notes
- I use google analytics to watch traffic.
- I have an rss feed setup at /feed.xml but more importantly I have it setup with [feedburner](https://feedburner.google.com)
  this is so I can get some stats on readership, with the direct rss feed there are no stats.
- I am using disqus for comments. Though comments could get out of hand and suck away my time they could also enable
  intelligent discussion that will help me clarify my thoughts and learn better. The potential gain is worth the risk.
- I am doing no ads the annoyance/gain trade off is solidly on the no ads side.
