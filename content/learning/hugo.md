I like static generated sites, simple, effective and secure. I love github pages as it gets the job done easily and well. Jekyll is a natural fit
with github pages and has been good to use.

Hugo needs a separate repo which is a bit of the pain. The [github pages tutorial](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog) does a great job at
explaining a few different git subrepo techniques and scripts to minimize the pain.

I like the clean directory layout better with Hugo.

I'm learning Go (this has been why I have not blogged in a bit) so Hugo has a bit of appeal even though I may not contribute. It is available in brew which I love and simple to get going.

I want disqus, rss, tags and love working in markdown and with yaml. All of it possible with Jekyll but some much easier with Hugo.
