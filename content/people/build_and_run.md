## You Build It, You Run It

My preferred way to work for various reasons:

* Satisfaction
  ** I am more satisfied to see my creations actually used.
  ** It is satisfying to see the forest and the trees, rather than only be stuck in the trees like some developerstyles lean toward.
* Wisdom
  ** I learn more when I get the feedback from the actual use, ie I make a much better product because of the ability to learn directly from my mistakes.
    *** Various operational concerns, such as security, good monitoring, etc are done much better by developers because of this.
  ** It is much easier to make a product that is relevant when you see and truly understand the whole.
    *** Also to make wise tradeoffs on features, development speed, security, etc.
  ** Doing is the best teacher. You can say you understand code but only work with high level architecture but I don't believe it. In a similar way you can say you understand running an app but only work on code but I don't believe that either.
