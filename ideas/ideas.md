# Potential Ideas
- Expand on the reasons I like Go, github.com/tkuhlman/golang-sig/various/beginners.txt
- Documentation driven development
  - Any other ideas related to code quality following up on my post about Dev best practices for
    sysadmins.
  - This follows on the idea that the reader of the code is the most important.
  - I should look into literate programming also as it seems a related idea
- I value a bias for action in software development.
  YAGNI is a important concept and you don't want to waste effort however I prefer a bias to action over endlessly planning.
  The amount of learning that can happen with actually trying something out in the code often makes the time better spent than additional reading and discussin.
  This isn't to discount the design portion which is highly important but just to say don't linger there.
  I have a poc.txt 1/2 written up which has many parallels to this idea.
- Development practices I need to remember to regularly use
  - Take advantage of Go's testable examples more.
  - Only one innovation per PR change
  - Remember to think of the reader of the code as the most important
  - Everything should be written to be testable
  - Focus is very important for programmers, aggressive remove distractions
  - Leveling up my communication skills is the way to level up my ability, even in technlogy
